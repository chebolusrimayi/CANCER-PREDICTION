<h3>Description:</h3>
<p style="color:white">cancer has identified a diverse condition of several subtypes. The timely screening and course of treatment of a cancer form now is a form is now a requirement in early cancer research because it 
supports the medical treatment of patients. Many research teams studied the application of ML and Deep Learning methods in the field of biomedicine and bioinformatics in the classification of people
with cancer across high-or-low-risk categories. These techniques have therefore been used as a model for the development and treatment of cancer. As,it is important that ML instuments are capable of 
detecting key features from complex datasets. Many of these methods are widely used for the development of predictive models for predicting a cure for cancer, some of the methods are artificial neural
networks(ANNs), support vector machine(SVMs) and decision trees(DTs). While we can understand cancer progression with the use of ML methods, an adequate validity level is needed to take these methods 
into consideration in clinical practice every day.
